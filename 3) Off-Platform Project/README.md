Off-Platform Project: Coded Correspondence
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy. Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements which describe the project you’ll be building.

There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy, and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
You and your pen pal, Vishal, have been exchanging letters for some time now. Recently, he has become interested in cryptography and the two of you have started sending encoded messages within your letters.

In this project, you will use your Python skills to decipher the messages you receive and to encode your own responses! Put your programming skills to the test with these fun cryptography puzzles.

Setup
We encourage you to complete this project on your own computer using Jupyter notebooks. To do so, continue following these instructions to get going.

If you’d prefer, you may also use the Codecademy learning environment to do this assignment. Get started by skipping the rest of these setup instructions and instead clicking Start. Then, complete the tasks in the code editor.
